# Customer Behavior Analysis – Banking Dataset

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer data from a banking institution to uncover behavioral patterns, segment customers, and derive actionable insights. It uses exploratory data analysis and interactive dashboards to help the bank make data-driven decisions for improving services, reducing risk, and enhancing customer satisfaction.

## Problem Statement
The bank seeks to better understand its customer base by identifying behavioral patterns and financial habits using historical customer data. With increasing competition and the need for personalized financial services, uncovering insights from demographics, banking behavior, and financial activities can help the bank optimize service offerings, improve customer retention, and reduce financial risk.

This project aims to analyze customer data to discover trends in customer segments, assess financial product usage, and highlight risk factors. Insights will support data-driven decision-making for customer engagement strategies and operational improvements.

- Identify product usage trends across different occupations and risk profiles
- Analyze customer loyalty, credit activity, and financial holdings
- Provide recommendations for customer targeting and risk mitigation

## Tools & Technologies
